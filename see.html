                  <h4>Everyone.</h4>
                  <p>Regardless of race, gender, and whether you are being abused or not, domestic violence affects everyone.<br></p>
                  </p>
                  
                  <center><h1>What is Happening?</h1></center>
                  <hr class="small">
                  
                  <p>Domestic violence is any kind of behavior that a person uses to control an intimate partner through fear and intimidation. It includes physical, sexual, psychological, verbal, and economic abuse. Some examples of domestic abuse include battering, name-calling and insults, threats to kill or harm one's partner or children, destruction of property, and marital rape.<br>
                  </p>
                  
                  <center><h1>When and Where Does it Happen?</h1></center>
                  <hr class="small">
                  <p>Anywhere and everywhere at anytime.</p>
                  <br>
                  
                  <center><h1>Why does it Happen?</h1></center>
                  <hr class="small">
              
                  <h4>For Victims:</h4>
                  <p>Victims stay with their abusers primarily out of fear. Some fear that they will lose their children. Many believe that they cannot support themselves, much less their children.<br></p>
                  <p>When the first violent act occurs, the victim is likely to be incredulous. They believe when the abuser apologizes and promises that it will not happen again. When it does—repeatedly—many victims believe that if they just act differently they can stop the abuse. They may be ashamed to admit that the partner they love is terrorizing them. Some cannot admit or realize that they are being battered. Others have endured trauma and suffer from battered womaen syndrome.<br></p>
                  
              
                  <h4>For Abusers:</h4>
                  <p>Domestic violence is learned behavior. People who batter learn to abuse through observation, experience, and reinforcement. They believe that they have a right to use violence; they are also rewarded, that is, their behavior gives them power and control over their partner.<br></p>
                  <p>Abusive partners come from all economic classes, races, religions, and occupations. The batterer may be a "good provider" and a respected member of his church and community. While there is no one type, people who abuse share some common characteristics. They tend to be extremely jealous, possessive, and easily angered. Many try to isolate their partners by limiting their contact with family and friends.<br></p>
                  <p>Typically, abusive partners deny that the abuse is happening, or they minimize it. They often blame their abusive behavior on someone or something other than themselves. They tell their partner, "You made me do this."<br></p>
                  <p>Many abusive men hold a view of women as inferior. Their conversation and language reveal their attitude towards a woman's place in society. Many believe that men are meant to dominate and control women.<br></p>
                  <p>Alcohol and drugs are often associated with domestic violence, but they do not cause it. An abuser who drinks or uses drugs has two distinct problems: substance abuse and violence. Both must be treated.<br></p>
